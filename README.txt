Project: Frequency Divider
by Tyler Edwards and Michael Cheng
Added October 2023 

Description: The circuit divides the clock frequency by half then in fourths. Meanwhile, the code demonstrates this functionality.

Hardware / Software Used:
- Verilog
- Logisim
- Breadboard Kit

Reason: For CPSC 330L (Digital Logic)

Successes: Working with logic and state diagrams was new, but I was able to pick it up quickly. Also, dividing the work then helping the other to understand it allowed for both, my partner and I to efficiently utilize our skills, while learning the other's specialty.

Setbacks: I have not worked with Verilog prior to this, so I learned as IK worked on the code for this project.

Learned: How to work with Logisim, how to work with Verilog, how to display outputs using FSM and State Diagrams
